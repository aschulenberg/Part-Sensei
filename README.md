# Part-Sensei
Have you ever sent a list of parts to get ordered only for them to go obsolete without your knowledge? Say no more because Part Sensei is here.

## Goal
Take an xcel or text file full of parts and search websites like Digikey and Arrow for the part. Check weather the part is still active or obsolete. If a part is obselete then list it in the output window.
